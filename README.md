CAN Bus–Based Vehicle Telemetry & ECU Simulation    
November 2025 
● Implemented a two-node CAN bus system using Arduino Uno + MCP2515 modules to simulate a full vehicle ECU, 
implementing throttle, braking, indicators, headlight control, fuel modeling, and real-time physics. 
● Built a Python (Pygame) desktop dashboard that renders a live virtual instrument cluster with RPM, speedometer, 
odometer, fuel gauge, blinkers, brake indicator, and headlight state synced over CAN in real time. 
● Tested a structured CAN messaging protocol, fault-tested the bus under sustained load, and validated reliable bidirectional 
communication through custom stress tests, echo verification, and dynamic state simulation. 

still a work in progress for my research paper.
